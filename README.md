<h1>Dear friends,</h1>
I'm not sure if you're able to read this. The odds of this are 1 in a 100(like I usually say, if you haven't noticed). But, if you do find yourself reading this(especially you, megarion), I recommend sharing this message to, the others. No, I have not been hacked, but my discord account has been disabled. No, I've not been mentally unstable again nor depressed as some may assume, I am perfectly fine with the exception of my ability to socialize. I guess I'm too young for the internet. But I must pay for the actions I've done, especially, verbally. No, I've not been grounded. Although I have recieved a sanction of my, actions, in discord - my socialism hub and my way of coping through this pandemic. And for whatever you assume, even if you believe my words or not, I do not blame you. I wish, and I truly wish, I would be able to talk to you again friends, the times we had laughing about little things, the times we had when we were acting like idiots for fun, I will miss that.

I remember the first time I've been on discord. "This is quite the generic social media application" I thought. It wasn't. In fact, it was the best. I was able to find people to talk to about certain topics and millions of communities you could choose from. An app where you could greet your friends anywhere anytime as long as you had internet or data ðŸš—.

And funnily enough, an application my parents wouldn't bother to inspect on my phone. Atleast, that is what I thought.

But unfortunately as the complete degenerate I am, I screwed it up, and now I'm sorry, but goodbye. At the very least, I was able to ade my farewells formally and properly.

<strong>Thanks for helping me not fall apart Eleva, Nyom, Kro, Megarion, Epoch, Alyssa, Bouncy Castles Manager, Bappo, Pred, Dragon, Saksham.</strong>
You guys showed me I was accepted as a guy you will most likely never meet in person as a friend anymore.

Sincerely,
